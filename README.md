Abstract 

Probability amplitude waves described by quantum mechanics are globally coherent relativistically 
space-like space-time structures, having no internal causal links. In this sense these non-classical 
structures  are anticipated by the classical ontology of special relativity, which also delineates 
(in a completely different way) space-like non-causal intervals in space-time. I discuss and distinguish 
two broad classes of globally coherent relativistically space-like space-time structure, and suggest 
a parsimonious extension of the core ontology of physics to include both of them (rather than only one
as at present), as a way of resolving some puzzles in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, and motivating
its formalism.  I show how this ontological extension immediately yields well known formal features usually
postulated  ad-hoc, such as separability of the wave function, and explains the puzzling absolute nature
of time in quantum mechanics. The curious fact that the ontologies of both special relativity and quantum
mechanics delineate (in strikingly different ways) strictly non-causal intervals in space-time suggests
the existence of an explanatory “last common ancestor” ontology, at a higher level of abstraction than
the ontologies  of either. I briefly sketch such an ontology, consisting of world self-mappings, in terms
of which there are two distinct concepts of time, intrinsic and extrinsic, which together play an abstract
identity role in the world, and which suggest part of the meaning of quantum mechanics, and of the non-causal
coherence of it’s non-classical waves, concerns extrinsic structure, in particular extrinsic time.
